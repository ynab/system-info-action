Dependent\n     * tasks are specified as parameters to the function, after the usual callback\n     * parameter, with the parameter names matching the names of the tasks it\n     * depends on. This can provide even more readable task graphs which can be\n     * easier to maintain.\n     *\n     * If a final callback is specified, the task results are similarly injected,\n     * specified as named parameters after the initial error parameter.\n     *\n     * The autoInject function is purely syntactic sugar and its semantics are\n     * otherwise equivalent to [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}.\n     *\n     * @name autoInject\n     * @static\n     * @memberOf module:ControlFlow\n     * @method\n     * @see [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}\n     * @category Control Flow\n     * @param {Object} tasks - An object, each of whose properties is an {@link AsyncFunction} of\n     * the form 'func([dependencies...], callback). The object's key of a property\n     * serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used\n     * when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n     * * The `callback` parameter is a `callback(err, result)` which must be called\n     *   when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of\n     *   the function's execution. The remaining parameters name other tasks on\n     *   which the task is dependent, and the results from those tasks are the\n     *   arguments of those parameters.\n     * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional callback which is called when all\n     * the tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks`\n     * pass an error to their callback, and a `results` object with any completed\n     * task results, similar to `auto`.\n     * @returns {Promise} a promise, if no callback is passed\n     * @example\n     *\n     * //  The example from `auto` can be rewritten as follows:\n     * async.autoInject({\n     *     get_data: function(callback) {\n     *         // async code to get some data\n     *         callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array');\n     *     },\n     *     make_folder: function(callback) {\n     *         // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n     *         // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n     *         callback(null, 'folder');\n     *     },\n     *     write_file: function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {\n     *         // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n     *         // write the data to a file in the directory\n     *         callback(null, 'filename');\n     *     },\n     *     email_link: function(write_file, callback) {\n     *         // once the file is written let's email a link to it...\n     *         // write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n     *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});\n     *     }\n     * }, function(err, results) {\n     *     console.log('err = ', err);\n     *     console.log('email_link = ', results.email_link);\n     * });\n     *\n     * // If you are using a JS minifier that mangles parameter names, `autoInject`\n     * // will not work with plain functions, since the parameter names will be\n     * // collapsed to a single letter identifier.
